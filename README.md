# Python Sentiment Analyzer

### About:

This program computes a sentiment score for a body of text stored in a dataset (in this case input.txt) and returns the score both graphically and numerically to the user as a percentile.

The program scores the text in three different ways:

- As it is presented in the dataset as one big body of text
- As one big body of text with stop words removed
- Each sentence individually
